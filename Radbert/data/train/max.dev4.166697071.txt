Rotation+
NGT, Left IJV line seen.
Surgical clip is seen in right axilla. Right mastectomy status. 
Multiple tiny to small  discrete nodular opacities  are seen scattered in both lung fields -likely Metastatic. 
High radio-density opaque seen in overlapping the medial end of left clavicle and posterior end of 4th rib.
CP angles and domes of the diaphragm are normal.
 Both hila are normal. Pulmonary vasculature is normal. 
Cardiac size and configuration is normal. 
Trachea is central; no mediastinal shift is seen. 
Visualized skeleton shows increased bone density   -likely bony metastasis.
Suggested clinical correlation.
