Results:
ICD tube seen on left side. 
Small pockets of air column with paucity of lung markings are seen along left lateral chest wall-?bullae ?loculated pneumothorax. 
Hyperinflated bilateral mid and lower zones with fibrotic changes are seen in bilateral lung fields predominantly in upper zones with subtle cystic lucencies - COPD 
 Left CP angle is blunted - ? Pleural effusion ? pleural thickening  
Both hila are normal. Pulmonary vasculature is normal.
Cardiac size and configuration is normal.
Trachea is central; no mediastinal shift is seen.
Bony thorax and soft tissues of the chest wall are normal.
Suggested clinical correlation.
