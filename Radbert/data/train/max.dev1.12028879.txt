5111994|91199|X-Ray Chest PA/AP View of 29-DEC-2016:
Results:
There is bilateral pleural effusion with the fluid tracking along the lateral chest walls. Areas of fibrosis and atelectasis are seen in the left lower zone, and in the right mid & lower zones with small areas of consolidation on the right.
There is unfolding of aorta. The linear density in the retrocardiac region could represent atherosclerotic calcification in the aorta. 
Cardiac size is mildly increased.
A central line is seen in situ.
