5051044|41513|X-Ray Chest PA/AP/Lat Views of 16-NOV-2016:
A small nodular density is seen in the right base. No other focal lesion seen in the lung parenchyma. 
CP angles and domes of the diaphragm are normal.
Both hila are normal. Pulmonary vasculature is normal.
Cardiac size and configuration is normal.
Trachea is central; no mediastinal shift is seen.
There is deformity of the left 3th rib with a radio-opaque foreign body seen adjoining this. 
X-ray Left Humerus/Arm (AP & Lat) of 16-NOV-2016:
Multiple radio-opaque foreign bodies are seen in the soft tissues of the arm. 
No definite cortical break is seen in the bones under view. Sclerosis along the superior surface of the greater tuberosity is likely to be secondary to a rotator cuff pathology. 
Clinical correlation is necessary.
