X-RAY CHEST (PA VIEW)


Patchy opacities are seen in bilateral hilar regions (likely consolidations).

Left costophrenic angle is blunted (possibly due to minimal 

pleural thickening / effusion).

The cardio thoracic ratio is normal.

The heart size and configuration are within normal limits.

The aortic arch is normal.

The bones and soft tissues of the chest wall show no abnormality.
