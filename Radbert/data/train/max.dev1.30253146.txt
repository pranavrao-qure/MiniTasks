5359546|296082|X-Ray Chest PA/AP View of 07-APR-2017:
MRI Brain Plain of 07-APR-2017:
Result :
Serial sections of the brain were obtained in sagittal, cornal and axial planes using T1, T2, and FLAIR images. 
Multiple discrete and confluent T2W and FLAIR hyperintensity are seen in bilateral periventricular and centrum semiovale region.
Few old infarct are seen in right basal ganglia.
	
Rest of brain parenchyma shows normal MR morphology and gray-white differentiation. There is no focal parenchymal lesion.
The basal cisterns and superficial subarachnoid CSF spaces are normal.
The ventricular system is normal.
The midbrain, pons and medulla are normal.
The cerebellar hemispheres are normal.
Visualized parts of the sella,5th, 7th and 8th nerve complexes are grossly normal on routine brain imaging.
Major flow voids are present.
IMPRESSION: MR scan of Brain  reveals chronic ischemic changes .
