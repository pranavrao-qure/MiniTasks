5531860|442171|X-Ray Chest PA/AP View of 11-JUN-2017:
Results:
Endotracheal tube is seen in situ. Slight haziness is seen in the right lung field with obscured right CP angle. 
Left lung and CP angle are clear. 
Cardiac size is prominent.
Trachea is central; no mediastinal shift is seen.
Old fracture of right 5th rib is seen.
Clinical correlation would be necessary. 
?
CT Head / Brain - Plain of 11-JUN-2017:
Results:
Confluent hypodensity is seen in bilateral frontal and parietal white matter. Small hemorrhagic focus is seen in the left parietal lobe. 
The basal ganglia and thalami are normal. 
The posterior fossa structures including the brain stem and cerebellum do not show any abnormality.
The ventricular system, cisternal & sulcal spaces are diffusely prominent.
IMPRESSION:
"	Small hemorrhagic focus in the left parietal lobe. 
"	Confluent hypodensity in bilateral frontal and parietal white matter, likely chronic ischemic.
"	Diffuse cerebral atrophy. 
Suggest MRI correlation.
