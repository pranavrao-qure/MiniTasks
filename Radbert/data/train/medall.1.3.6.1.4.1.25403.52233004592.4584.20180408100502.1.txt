There are fibrocavitatory opacities in the bilateral upper zones with pulled up hilum. 

Patchy opacities are seen in the bilateral mid zones. 

There are large thin walled cystic lucencies in the bilateral upper zones - may represent cavitatory lesions. 

Right hilum is prominent - probably lymphnode. 

Cardiac size is within normal limits.

Bilateral domes of diaphragm and costophrenic angles are normal.

Visualised bones and soft tissues appear normal.

The findings are suggestive of infective etiology - probably pulmonary Kochs and its sequelae. 

Suggested correlation with lab findings / further evaluation with CECT.
