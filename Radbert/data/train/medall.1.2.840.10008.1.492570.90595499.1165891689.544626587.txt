X-RAY CHEST (PA VIEW)

Opacification of the entire left hemithorax is noted with volume loss as evidenced by shift of the mediastinum to the left and crowding of ribs. 
Dilated bronchi are seen - suggestive of associated bronchiectasis.

A calcific focus is seen in the left upper zone of lung.

Right apical pleural thickening with mild fibrotic changes are seen in the right upper zone of lung and small calcific foci in the right mid zone.

Rest of the right lung is clear.

The cardia is obscured due to shift of mediastinum.

The costophrenic and cardiophrenic recesses and the domes of diaphragm are normal on the right.

The bones and soft tissues of the chest wall otherwise show no abnormality.

IMPRESSION: 

vDense left hemithorax with mediastinal shift to left - suggestive of fibrothorax with bronchiectasis.

vRight apical pleural thickening with mild fibrotic changes in the right upper zone and calcific foci in the right mid zone of lung.

These findings suggest sequelae of previous tuberculosis.
When compared to the previous chest X-ray done on 28.07.2010, there is no 
significant change.
