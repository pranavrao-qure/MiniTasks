6393202|5688761|X-Ray Para Nasal Sinuses [PNS] of 21-APR-2018:
The sinuses under view show moderate pneumatisation.
Bilateral maxillary are clear. There is mild haziness in the frontal sinuses which could be due to thickened mucosa. .
No gross nasal septal deviation noted.
X-Ray Chest PA/AP View of 21-APR-2018:
No focal lesion seen in the lung parenchyma. 
CP angles and domes of the diaphragm are normal.
Both hila are normal. Pulmonary vasculature is normal.
Cardiac size is normal. There is prominence of the pericardial fat at the left cardiophrenic angle. 
No mediastinal shift is seen.
CT Whole Abdomen - Plain of 21-APR-2018:
The liver does not show any focal lesion on this non contrast study.
No radio-opaque calculus is seen in the gall bladder. The biliary passages, pancreas, spleen, adrenals and kidneys are within normal limits.
The distal esophagus is mildly prominent. The  stomach  is unremarkable. The small bowel loops do not show any definite dilatation or narrowing. The colon is loaded. 
There is prominence of the intra-abdominal peritoneal fat without any overt haziness of the fat or evidence of free fluid.  A small umbilical hernia containing fat is seen. A small calcific density is seen in the sigmoid mesocolon. 
Small nodes are seen in the celiac axis, retroperitoneum and mesentery. 
The urinary bladder, seminal vesicles and prostate are normal.
IMPRESSION
No definite abnormality is seen in the abdomen. The prominence of the peritoneal fat and small abdominal nodes are non specific. 
The prominence of the distal esopahgus could be due to a hiatus hernia and may be clinically correlated.
