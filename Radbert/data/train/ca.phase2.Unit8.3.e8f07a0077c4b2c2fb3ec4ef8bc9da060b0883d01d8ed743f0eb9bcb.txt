X-ray Chest PA view:

Rotation+

LUNGS: Heterogenous opacities with patchy areas of haziness , linear atelectatic bands / fibrotic strands  and cystic changes seen in lung fields.
Homogenous opacities in bilateral basal zones with obscuration of costophrenic angles and dome of diaphragm.
PLEURA: Pleural thickening seen along left upper lateral chest wall
There is blunting of bilateral costophrenic angles, which may represent pleural effusion/thickening.  

HEART: Normal. 
AORTA: Normal. 

THORACIC SPINE: Degenerative changes of the spine are noted. 
OTHER VISUALIZED BONES: Normal. 
VISUALIZED SOFT TISSUES: Normal. 
DIAPHRAGM: Obscured. 

VISUALIZED NECK:  A rounded calcific density seen along right lateral border of T1 vertebra, s/o calcific lymph node.
Report Impression: 
-Heterogenous opacities with patchy areas of haziness , linear atelectatic bands / fibrotic strands  and cystic changes  in lung fields.
-Homogenous opacities in bilateral basal zones with obscuration of costophrenic angles and dome of diaphragm - may represent pleural effusion/thickening ( Adv: USG Correlation)  
Findings represent sequelae of infective etiology.

Recommend clinical correlation and with lab parameters.
