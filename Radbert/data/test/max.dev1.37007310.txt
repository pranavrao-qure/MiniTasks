Results :
Rotation+
Inhomogeneous fibrocystic opacities are seen in left lung with reduced left lung volume and resultant shift of trachea and mediastinum towards left  
Left CP angle is blunted with laminar opacity along left lateral chest wall suggesting pleural effusion with collapse consolidation
There is crowding of ribs along left lateral chest wall suggesting underlying healed fractures. 
There is compensatory hypertrophy of right lung with prominence of bronchovascular markings 
Right CP angle is clear. 
Cardiac size and configuration is normal.
Advise: Clinical correlation.
